# Database-Systems
Database Systems Notes; Prof. Shahram Ghandeharizadeh
This course provides an introduction to parallel database management systems that scale within and across data centers. It covers key topics such as physical data organization, NoSQL databases, cache-augmented systems, memory management, and disaggregated database systems. Students will learn about transactional storage managers and data analytics. The course includes discussions on ACID transactions, file systems, SDM, relational data models, and SQL. Students will also explore persistent index structures like hashing and B+-tree, relational algebra, normal forms, and the fundamentals of magnetic disk drives and solid-state drives. Other topics include algorithms like LRU, concurrency control protocols such as locking and time-stamp, and crash recovery protocols like logging. The course also introduces the FLOW actor model for rapid development of multi-node database systems, as applied in FoundationDB. Guest lectures from leading experts in the field, including Dr. Haoyu Huang (Google AlloyDB), Dr. Hieu Nguyen (eBay NuGraph), Dr. Doug Terry (Amazon DynamoDB), and Dr. Michael Carey (Couchbase Capella Columnar), will provide real-world insights. By the end of the semester, students will have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts, design decisions, protocols, and algorithms needed to build a database system using off-the-shelf software and hardware components, and will be equipped to apply analytics and ACID semantics to database systems and applications.
